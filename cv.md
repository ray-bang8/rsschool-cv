#### Code example:

##### Get the Middle Character KATA from Codewars:
_You are going to be given a word. Your job is to return the middle character of the word. If the word's length is odd, return the middle character. If the word's length is even, return the middle 2 characters_.

```javascript
function getMiddle(s)
{
  if(s.length%2 == 0) {
    return s.slice(s.length/2 - 1, s.length/2 + 1)
  } else {
    return s.slice(s.length/2, s.length/2 + 1)
  }
}
```
